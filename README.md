A simple Todo web application that allows users to manage their tasks. Users can add, update, and delete tasks, with all data stored locally in the browser.

## Features

- **Create New Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their list.
- **Update Tasks:** Users can edit existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can remove tasks they no longer need.
- **Local Storage:** All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist between sessions.
